## This file describes the process of succesfully compiling the package
   on Windows 

o Requirements: Windows XP 32bit, virtual machine (xmzeus.wu.ac.at, R-Forge
build server), proper build environment (Rtools etc.)

o Download the Windows binaries from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/ 

o extract the .zip file and set the path to the extracted files as
GLPK_HOME in your environment

o TODO: currently one has to change the GLPK_LIBS = -lglpk_4_42
according to the current version of GLPK in Makevars.win

o Build the binary as usual.
