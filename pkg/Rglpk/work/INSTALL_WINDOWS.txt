## This file describes the process of succesfully compiling the package
   on Windows 

o Requirements: Windows XP 32bit, virtual machine (xmzeus.wu.ac.at, R-Forge
build server), proper build environment (Rtools etc.)

o Open the Windows command shell, copy the GLPK sources from the
package and build the static library using (see also configure):
sh ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --with-pic --disable-dependency-tracking

NOTE: one needs to provide chmod.exe, sleep.exe and uname.exe from
cygwin somewhere in the PATH, otherwise configure won't work

o copy the binaries to the path set in the GLPK_HOME variable in your
environment 

o TODO: currently one has to change the GLPK_LIBS = -lglpk_4_42
according to the current version of GLPK in Makevars.win

o Build the binary as usual.
