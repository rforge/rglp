Title: R/GNU Linear Programming Kit Interface
Author: Stefan Theussl
Maintainer: Stefan Theussl <stefan.theussl@wu-wien.ac.at>
Description: R interface to the GNU Linear Programing Kit (GLPK - Version 4.23).
	     GLPK is an open source software for solving large-scale 
	     linear programming (LP), mixed integer linear programming (MILP) 
	     and other related problems.
	     Unlike package glpk which ports all of the low-level C API 
	     functions to R, Rglpk provides a high level interface to R
	     for solving LP/MILP problems using GLPK.
Depends: R (>= 2.6.0)
License: GPL version 2.1 or newer
