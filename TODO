* version string 4.39 
  since version 4.39 of the GLPK library the wrong version number is
   printed: 4.29

* duplicated entries in constraint matrix
	if duplicated entries in the constraint matrix occur then before exiting look if the 
	whole constraint is really the same, if so delete one of them and print out a warning 
	otherwise stop. In C code remove the abort call as it directly exits R. Replace it with 
	something similar like stop().
   Nevertheless a function like check constraint matrix for sanity
   should be included.
   UPDATE: partially solved: replaced abort(); with xerror("Execution aborted.").

* data structure for read_file
   doesn't work yet to solve a read problem as there is something wrong
   with the max argument. I think x$max -> "maximize". this has to be fixed

* Interior point solver
   integrate interior point solver
