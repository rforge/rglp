* integer/binary variables
	Are the integer variables really integers? that means how accurate is the integer solution?	
	or do we need something like:	

solution[int] <- round(solution[int])

* duplicated entries in constraint matrix
	if duplicated entries in the constraint matrix occur then before exiting look if the 
	whole constraint is really the same, if so delete one of them and print out a warning 
	otherwise stop. In C code remove the abort call as it directly exits R. Replace it with 
	something similar like stop().
